- challenges in large-scale ml
    - more variation in data
        - feature engineering and modeling are more difficult
    - growing, changing data
        - online learning, lifelong learning
    - larger volume of data
        - large k (features): curse of dimensionality
            - low-dimensional representation learning
            - feature selection methods
            - efficient data structures
        - large n (observations): needs efficient learning
            - faster processing, e.g., use stochastic gradient descent instead of gradient descent
            - approximation methods, e.g., subsample the data
            - parallel methods
                - multi-core: when data can fit on a single machine
                - distributed: when data cannot fit on a single machine
- Apache Spark
    - general, open-source cluster computing engine
    - APIs in Scala, Python, Java, R
