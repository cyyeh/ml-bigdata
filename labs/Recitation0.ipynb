To move through the notebook just run each of the cells.  You will not need to solve any problems to complete this lab.  You can run a cell by pressing \"shift-enter\", which will compute the current cell and advance to the next cell, or by clicking in a cell and pressing \"control-enter\", which will compute the current cell and remain in that cell."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### ** Part 1: Attach and test class helper library **"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### (1a) Install class helper library into your Databricks CE workspace\n- The class helper library is called \"nose\"\n- You can install the library into your workspace following the following instructions:\n - Step 1: Click on \"Workspace\", then on the dropdown and select \"Create\" and \"Library\"\n\n<img src=\"http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/Lab0_Library1.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" />\n - Step 2 Enter the name of the library by selecting \"Upload Python Egg or PyPI\" and entering \"nose\" in the \"PyPI Name\" field\n\n\n - Step 3 Make sure the checkbox for auto-attaching the library to your cluster is selected"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### ** Part 2: Test Spark functionality **"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["** (2a) Create a DataFrame and filter it **\n\nWhen you run the next cell (with control-enter or shift-enter), you will see the following popup.\n\n<img src=\"http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/Lab0_Cluster.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" />\n\nSelect the click box and then \"Launch and Run\".
